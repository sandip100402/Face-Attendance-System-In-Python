# Face-Attendance-System-In-Python

A Face Attendance System is a system that uses facial recognition technology to automatically record attendance for individuals.
The system captures an individual's face using a camera and compares it to a pre-existing database of faces to identify the person.
Once the person is identified, their attendance is recorded and stored in an Excel file.
This project in Python would involve the development of a program that utilizes Python libraries for facial recognition and Excel file manipulation to automate the attendance recording process. 
The program would likely include functions for capturing images, comparing faces, recording attendance in an Excel file, and possibly generating reports.
